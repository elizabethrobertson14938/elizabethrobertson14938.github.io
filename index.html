	<H2> <i> About Me! </i> </H2>
	<p> Hi, my name is Elizabeth Neely Robertson. I am 19 years young. My birthday is May 3rd 1999. I was born and raised in Charlotte, NC. My favorite food is fried chicken and my favorite color is blue. Some of my hobbies include hanging out with my friends, playing lacrosse, and petting my dog. I have a dog named Charlie and he is a King Charles Cavalier. He is 13 years old. Charlie is very old but he still always has alot of energy and is very playful. </p>
	<H2> <i> About My Family </i> </H2>
	<p> I have a brother named Bill. Bill is currently a senior at UGA. Because we are close in age, we don't always get along. He likes to tease me and play jokes on me. Bill is funny and a good brother. I also have a mom named Kim. My mom is very caring and she is also a lawyer. My dad's name is Hugh. My dad loved to coach my brother and I in sports when we were little. My dad is funny and tall. </p> 
	<H2> <i> About My Education </H2> </i>
	<p> Currently, I am a student at <A href="https://www.uga.edu"> The University of Georgia </A>. I am a Business major, and I want to maybe be a lawyer one day. I hope to attend law school after I graduate. Some of my favorite classes at UGA include Computer Science, Accounting, and Geography. Another dream job of mine is a veternarian. I love animals and it would be so interesting to work as a veternarian. I also want to do a study abroad at some point in college, a place I would like to visit is Europe. </p>
